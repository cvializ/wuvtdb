###dan's idea 

My feature requests for the new Quicktrack are the ability to scan a
barcode (possibly with a Cue-Cat) and automatically have Quicktrack
pull the information of the CD and only make the user select the
track. The other feature is to set up a 'to play' queue that you can
fire off to the live 'playing' queue in any order you want, so that
you can queue up a bunch during a long song and fire them off when you
don't have as much time. Thinking of it now it would be cool to be
able to import a previously made playlist to fire off as you play the
songs (offline DJ only playlist generation server).  We've also been
talking about playing with Rivendell (http://www.rivendellaudio.org/)
for a while so it would be nice if whatever we write would be
compatible. Let me know when you want to do the ...err.. project
kickoff ... meeting.
